# Save Earth

‚≠ê _Recognised as a quarter finalist in the Technovation Girls Challenge_


As of 2020, more than [six Nigerians out of 10 never heard about climate change.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1269701/knowledge-of-climate-change-topic-in-nigeria-by-area/#:~:text=As%20of%202020%2C%20more%20than,Nigeria%20than%20in%20rural%20areas.) Additionally, 100% of Nigerians have little knowledge on the climate crisis acoording to a survey I conducted. 

The pressing issue of climate change remains a global concern that requires immediate attention and collective action. Nigeria witnessed its most devastating flooding event in 2022, displacing millions. 

In response to this critical challenge, I developed Save Earth, designed to educate, inspire, and empower users to take action against climate change.
